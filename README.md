### Tired of constantly wasting money of VALORANT skins?

If you think about it, you can only *really* use one skin per gun, so why buy multiple?

With this website, you can guarantee that you buy your single favorite skin per gun, by browsing through almost\* all the skins for every single weapon in the game. Your choices are stored to your browser's local storage, so you'll never accidentally forget them. The recreation of VALORANT's in-game UI also makes the site very user-friendly.

\* Due to VALORANT API limitations, some of the skins are unavailable. See the [full list here](./missingSkins.txt).
